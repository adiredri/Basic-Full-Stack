# Full-Stack Basics – Web Development Exercises

This repository contains two beginner-level full-stack web development assignments, built as part of a university course. Each project demonstrates frontend structure, styling, and interactive elements using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The second assignment also includes basic usage of Bootstrap.

Projects are organized into two folders: `WORK1` and `WORK2`, each containing its own HTML, CSS, and relevant resources.

A static simulation of a Google-style search engine interface.
